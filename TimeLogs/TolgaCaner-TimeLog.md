Read following resources: <a href="http://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka">Baeldung's Eureka Tutorial</a> <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/service-registration-and-discovery/">Spring Eureka Service Registration and Discovery</a> <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/01/20/microservice-registration-and-discovery-with-spring-cloud-and-netflix-s-eureka">Microservice registration and discovery with Spring Cloud and Netflix's Eureka</a> and many other stackoverflow posts. Could not find a permanent solution yet though I <a href="https://github.com/swe574-group2/swe574/issues/51#issuecomment-260300030">advised</a> my teammates not to care for a while. |
|9|  <a href="https://github.com/swe574-group2/swe574/issues/51">#51</a>                | 180 minutes       | 400 minutes         | The issue is fixed with a <a href="https://github.com/swe574-group2/swe574/issues/51#issuecomment-261878046">closing comment explaining the changes</a>. |

|11|  <a href="https://github.com/swe574-group2/swe574/issues/60">#60</a>                | 180 minutes       | 400 minutes         | Finalizing and explaining to the client team many changes we had at the time. There was lots of minor bug fixes done which had no seperate issue. |
|12|  <a href="https://github.com/swe574-group2/swe574/issues/56">#56</a>                | 180 minutes       | 250 minutes         | Routed post requests from the user micro-service to the annotation micro-service using the 307 Temporary Redirect status code. I could use 302 Found, 301 Moved Permanently or 308 Permanent Redirect but since the 307 worked like a charm I didn't see any need to change it. Also, I tried to help the client team with their registration bug, I managed to work it locally but I couldn't make it work on their PCs. Hope to look into that before the next presentation.|
